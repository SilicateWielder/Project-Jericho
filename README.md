# Project-Jericho
TL;DR: This is a code-named, City-builder feasibility test.

Long version:

Project Jericho is the codename for a feasibility test into city simulation. It's purpose for existing right now is due to my own grievances with modern simulation titles (C:S2) but also a longing 
for the older styles of games like The pre-2013 entries in the Sim City franchise.

Project paradigms:
 - Maintain a functional approach to programming within the simulation codebase. 
 - Find innovative ways to optimize performance under absurd circumstances (to spite the trend of performance-second approaches to game dev).
 - Determine whether or not this entire project has any functional basis.
 - Ensure the simulation is modular, and can be dropped-in-place easily.
